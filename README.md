You search for places around a location and display the photos found for these locations. You can either search by venue name or location type like 'restaurants', 'hotels'.

Searching for a venue, brings up 'suggested keywords' and selecting one or executing an explicit search displays a list of results. The results can also be displayed on a map view by clicking on the 'map' floating action button at the bottom of the search results screen.
